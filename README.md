|| [History of foty.js](https://github.com/MonikaLobinger/foty/commits/main/_scripts/foty.js) || [All main commits](https://github.com/MonikaLobinger/foty/commits/main) ||

This script  [foty.js](https://github.com/MonikaLobinger/foty/blob/main/_scripts/foty.js) is called from template [atest_Vorlage.md](https://github.com/MonikaLobinger/foty/blob/main/_vorlagen/atest_Vorlage.md)

## Previous
The precursor of this script [onne.js](https://github.com/MonikaLobinger/foty/blob/main/_scripts/onne.js) is called from template [One_Vorlage.md](https://github.com/MonikaLobinger/foty/blob/main/_vorlagen/One_Vorlage.md)

But this is much to complicated and unstructured for my taste and it is not generic - changing my needs or being used for other users needs will result in code changes (not only data changes)

## Current
So I am working on a generic version. 

Not only because  I am not a JS programmer this is complicated for me.
